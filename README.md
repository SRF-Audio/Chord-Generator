# Chord-Generator
Created with CodeSandbox

## About

Chord Generator is a web app by Stephen Froeber, for songwriters and composers to quickly generate and listen to interesting chord ideas.
The application uses Web Audio API and Tonal.

## Chord Generator will be able to do 3 things:

1) Generate a musically sensible, interesting set of 8 Chords
2) Play those chords interactively with user input
3) Display relevant chord information

## Development Status

I am still in the early phases of building out the app, and basic functionality.
